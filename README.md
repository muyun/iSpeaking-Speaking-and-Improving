#### Project Description  
**iSpeaking: Speaking and Improving** is a web-based automatic system for L2 (English&Chinese) learners, which could recognize learners' voice and compare that with the correct way to pronounce anything. Trainees could learn anytime, anywhere, and get instant feedback from proprietary artificial intelligence technology. This is very helpful when trainees track learning progress and specific patterns, and thus improve their speaking clearly and confidently like their own mother tongue.
